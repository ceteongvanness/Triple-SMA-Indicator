## üìä Strategy Logic

### Signal Generation Rules

#### Buy Signals (Long Entry)
- **Primary**: Price > SMA20 > SMA50 > SMA200
- **RSI Filter**: 35 < RSI < 75 (avoid extreme conditions)
- **Volume Confirmation**: Current volume > 1.2x average volume
- **Proximity Check**: Price within 5% of SMA20

#### Sell Signals (Short Entry/Long Exit)
- **Primary**: Price < SMA20 < SMA50 < SMA200
- **RSI Filter**: 25 < RSI < 65 (avoid extreme conditions)
- **Volume Confirmation**: Current volume > 1.2x average volume
- **Proximity Check**: Price within 5% of SMA20

#### Signal Strength Calculation
```python
signal_strength = (sma_spread * 0.4) + (rsi_strength * 0.3) + (volume_strength * 0.3)
# Strong signals: >60% strength
# Weak signals: ‚â§60% strength
```

## üí∞ Risk Management

### Position Sizing Formula
```python
max_risk_per_trade = account_value * 0.02  # 2% rule
position_size = max_risk_per_trade / stop_loss_distance
max_shares = min(position_size, account_value * 0.10 / stock_price)
```

### Stop Loss Calculation
```python
# For long positions
stop_loss = entry_price - (2 * ATR)

# For short positions  
stop_loss = entry_price + (2 * ATR)
```

## üìà Visualization Features

### 4-Panel Dashboard
1. **Price Chart**: Candlestick data with SMA overlays and signal markers
2. **RSI Panel**: 14-period RSI with overbought/oversold zones
3. **Volume Analysis**: Volume bars with moving average comparison
4. **Signal Strength**: Time series of signal confidence levels

### Signal Markers
- üü¢ **Strong Buy**: Dark green triangles (>60% strength)
- üü¢ **Weak Buy**: Light green triangles (‚â§60% strength)
- üî¥ **Strong Sell**: Dark red triangles (>60% strength)  
- üî¥ **Weak Sell**: Light red triangles (‚â§60% strength)

## üîß Advanced Features

# Analyze multiple stocks simultaneously
